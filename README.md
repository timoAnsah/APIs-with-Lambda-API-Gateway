# APIs with Lambda + API-Gateway

APIs are legendary, they are in the background & we benefit from it. they are all about how different systems can talk to each other.
In this project I demonstrate how to set up an API using AWS Lambda & API Gateway to learn how APIs work & also set up a logic tier for an application.

# Purpose & Motivation
design & deploy a serverless backend API on AWS using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway, without managing servers.
The goal is to show a clear understanding of how HTTP requests are routed, processed, and returned as structured JSON responses in a modern cloud-native architecture. The focus is on core backend fundamentals: service integration, permissions, observability, and scalability not complex business logic.
This is how real-world APIs are built to be cost-efficient, scalable, and operationally simple.

# AWS Services Used: 
- API Gateway
- Lambda

3 tier architectures splits applications into 3 essential layers: presentation, logic & data.
This project demonstrates the logic tier.
Its all about the backend of an application. 

This is where I will write & run code that translates user actions e.g. Button clicks, to application functionality e.g. Website Searches & data processing.
