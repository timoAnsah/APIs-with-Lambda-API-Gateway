In this project I will demonstrate how to set up an API using AWS Lambda & Amazon API Gateway 
I am doing this to learn how APIs work & also set up the logic tier for this three tier architecture.

Step 1
- Created a Lambda Function
- Condfigure the settings
- add code to retrieve user data

Lambda functions will fetch data from a database & return it to users. A common use case in Web Applications
for exampke when you search for a product in an online shop, the website backend needs to query the product database,
find the relevant product & send the details back to the browser as quickly as possible.
